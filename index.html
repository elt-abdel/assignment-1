<!-- 




A <div> element for your content body.
This element must also have a class selector on it
 Two generic block-level elements (div) nested within your content div, both with class selectors.
One of those <div> elements should contain an image (it doesn't have to be of you, but it should be family-friendly), followed by a short "caption" description contained in p tag of your real or imagined professional goals.
The other block-level element should contain a second-level header and at least 3 work history entries (real or imagined) in an ordered list. Create these in such a way that you can style each of the 3 entries at the same time.  Include:
A header of the appropriate level
A description of the job
And an unordered list of three responsibilities -->
